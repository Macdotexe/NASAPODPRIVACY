<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p><em>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at: </p><a href="mailto:&#112;&#97;&#114;&#115;&#97;&#97;&#114;&#x79;&#x61;&#x32;&#x30;&#49;&#50;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#112;&#97;&#114;&#115;&#97;&#97;&#114;&#x79;&#x61;&#x32;&#x30;&#49;&#50;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a></p>

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.</p>

<p>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
